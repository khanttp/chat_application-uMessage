A project for CSE 332 - Data Structure and Algorithms

Implemented various data structures and algorithms and the back-end for a chat application called "uMessage"


Implementations

    Worklists:
      - MinFourHeapComparable -> array-based heap data structure. 
      
    Dictionaries:
      - MoveToFrontList -> inherits deleteless dictionary. MoveToFrontList is a type of linked list where new items are inserted at the front of the list, 
                          and an existing item gets moved to the front whenever it is referenced. 
      - AVLTree
      - ChainningHashTable 
      - HashTrieMap 
      
    
     Algorithms:
      - HeapSort
      - QuickSort
      - TopKSort
